    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I use Anastasiia Chebotina's ['Fast Food Marketing Campaign A\\B Test'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test) dataset from Kaggle to analyse the results of a fictional A/B/n test. The dataset lays out the scenario and task below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Scenario*\n",
    "\n",
    "*A fast-food chain plans to add a new burger to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new burger.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><img src=\"https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/burger-king-mystery-burger-hed-2017.jpg\" style=\"max-width:350px\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "*In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new burger is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new burger are recorded for the first four weeks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Task*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Evaluate A/B testing results and decide which marketing strategy works the best.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of this notebook is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define hypothesis statement\n",
    "2. Collect data\n",
    "3. Omnibus test\n",
    "4. Post-hoc test\n",
    "5. Conclusions\n",
    "6. References\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 1 I define the hypothesis statement for the A/B/n test, and determine the most appropriate tests for this hypothesis - ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 2, I take a look at the data collected for the experiment. In a real A/B/n test, I would collect the primary data myself. In this case, the data is already provided in the Kaggle dataset, so I use this section to do a brief EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to get a feel for the data, and run any necessary cleaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Sections 3-5 I test the assumptions for ANOVA, run the test on the three promotions, and display the results along with some visualisations. The tests show that there is a significant difference in sales at stores using the different promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sections 6-7 I run post-hoc tests to determine whether any of the promotions had a significantly greater effect on sales. The tests reveal that...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Section 8 I discuss the results and implications of the test."

    "## 1. Define Hypothesis Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of any A/B/n test is the hypothesis statement. A good hypothesis clearly states what is being changed (the independent variable), what the success metric is (the dependent variable), and what the predicted outcome is. It should help to answer the question 'what do we want to learn from this test?' \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For this A/B/n test, I propose the following hypothesis statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "*We believe that at least one of the three marketing promotions will result in significantly higher sales of the burger in the first four weeks across randomly selected stores.* \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether this hypothesis statement is true, I will run two tests. For both tests, the significance level will be set at 0.05, the power at 0.8. The first test I will run is a one-way ANOVA test, which will tell us whether the sales of the stores differ based on the marketing promotion used. If this test gives a significant result, then we can conclude that at least one of the promotions had a significant effect on sales of the new burger; however, this test does not tell us which promotion had this effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, if the ANOVA is significant, the second test I will run is a post-hoc test (Tukey's HSD), which is a pairwise test that compares the sales of each group to the sales of every other group to detect a significant difference. The MDE (minimum detectable effect) will be set at 10%. Therefore, if the sales of one of the three groups is at least 10% higher than the others, and the Tukey's HSD determines that this result is significant, then we will consider the hypothesis statement to be true. Otherwise, we will reject the hypothesis statement."

    "The equal variance assumption requires that the variance of each group is roughly the same. There is no precise definition of what counts as 'equal variance', but there are some widely accepted rules of thumb to decide whether the variances are equal. I will use the heuristic that if the ratio of the larger variance to the smaller variance is less than 4, the sample variances are equal."

However, most of the literature I found on this topic refers to skewed distributions rather than bimodal distributions. Moreover, although ANOVA is robust against normality violations, non-parametric tests tend to have more statistical power when this assumption is violated. As such, I will use the non-parametric alternative to ANOVA for this A/B/n test - the Kruskal-Wallis test."
